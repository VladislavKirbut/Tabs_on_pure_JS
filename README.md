# Tabs_on_pure_JS
Tabs on JavaScript(JS)

// The 'tab' variable gets a class with all tabs.
// The 'info' variable gets a block with this tabs (the container in which the tabs are located).
// The 'tabContent' variable gets a block of content, which we divide into parts.

// Next created a function, that will hide our tabs(when called)...

 *the 'shaw' class shows our tabs.
 *The 'hide' class hide our tabs.

 Accordingly, these classes are described in the CSS. 

 // So, we created a function,that will show our tabs(when called)...

//Next, delegation is used. We hang the event on the block where the tabs are located, and then check that the click goes to the tab itself.
